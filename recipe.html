                <p>
                    This is how to make Jennifer's Rasta Pasta!
                    A little bit about me is that I am and always have been a beautiful 
                    woman who enjoys pasta and meat. I made this rasta pasta one day
                    in my apartment because I hungry. It was so incredible that I thought
                    I would share the recipe to others so they could feel how I felt that
                    day! Enjoy <3

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut up your Vegetables and airfry all of them on 375 for 30 mins.
                        After this, boil your pasta into a large pot for about 10 mins.
                        Do <strong>not</strong> overboil your pasta! If it is too soft, it
                        will not hold against the sauce and will break into a million pieces.
                    </li>
                    <li>Heat up a wok pan up to medium heat and add oil. We are going to wait
                        for this to heat up. Once its hot, add cut up peices of your beef Sausage
                        into the wok to fry. This should only take about 10 mins.
                    </li>
                    <li> When your vegetables are complete, blend them into a semi-thick sauce. 
                        Your sausage should be complete around this time. Take it out the pan
                        and put it in a separate bowl. We will be using this later.
                        Now, put your blended veggies in the same wok the sausages were in and let it cook.
                    </li>
                    <li>Your pasta should be boiled by now so take it out the pot, save a bit of pasts
                        water for later, and rinse it. Use the saved pasta water to put back into the pot to
                        avoid it drying too much. At the same time you can season your veggie mix as you prefer
                        and make sure you turn the sauce often so it does not burn at the bottom. You can add the sausage
                        back inside the pot at this time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Youre pasta is all rinsed out! Now we can put it back into the large pot and heat it back up.
                        Once heated, add the veggie sauce and mix it all together and you are done!
                    </li>
                </ol>
